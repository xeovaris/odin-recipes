Recipes Project Repo - The Odin Project

write a brief introduction describing what the current project is and what skills you will have demonstrated once you have completed it. (You can also do this as a self-reflection at the end of the project, which is a good way to review what you have learned.)


The Current Project

The current project is a website showcasing various recipes.  At the end of the project, I will have demonstrated the use of Git, HTML and command line.
