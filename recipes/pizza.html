        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Now found exclusively at one well-known pizza garden in Gravesend, Brooklyn, this style 
            of pizza was once found in neighborhood bakeries. This pizza is deceivingly light, crisp, 
            and slightly spicy. Enjoy with a can of soda.</p>
     
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            </ul>

            <h4>Cheese:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>8 oz low-moisture whole-milk mozzarella, very thinly sliced/li>

        </p>

        <p>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Step 1
                    <p>Combine water and yeast in a small bowl. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Step 2
                    <p>Combine flour and salt together in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment. Pour in yeast mixture. Knead dough until smooth, about 7 minutes.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Step 3
                    <p>Grease a large bowl lightly with olive oil. Form dough into a tight ball and lightly grease the top. Place in the bowl; cover loosely with plastic wrap. Let rise until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Step 4:
                    <p>Mix crushed tomatoes and pizza sauce together in a bowl to make sauce.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Step 5
                    <p>Grease a heavy-gauge rimmed 12x17-inch baking sheet generously with olive oil. Press dough into the bottom. Prick dough all over with a fork. Arrange mozzarella cheese slices over dough; cover with 1 cup sauce. 
                    Sprinkle Pecorino Romano cheese on top. Drizzle remaining olive oil over pizza.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Step 6
                    <p>Let pizza rise in a warm area until puffy, about 1 hour.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>Step 7
                    <p>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</p>
                </li>
                <li>Step 8
                    <p>Bake pizza on the center rack of the preheated oven until edges are very dark brown but top is not burnt, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool in the pan for 5 minutes before slicing into squares.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <h4>Cook's Note:</h4>
        <p> If substituting regular flour for the gluten-free kind, use 1 1/4 cups in the pasta and 1/4 cup in the sauce.
